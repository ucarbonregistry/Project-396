India and is one of the top 10 players in India in terms of capacity for iron ore pellets, iron ore
beneficiation and sponge iron.

The project activity entails utilisation of waste heat of flue gases generated in Direct Reduced Iron
(DRI) kilns of sponge iron plants of SBPIL (Project Proponent or PP hereafter) in power generation.
DRI, is a type of kiln used in the production of sponge iron, where iron ore is reduced to sponge
iron using coal & Iron ore through a rotary Kiln at high temperature (1000 0C). The reduction
process yields carbon di-oxide and carbon monoxide. The power produced is used actively at the
sponge iron interconnected plants of the PP within the project boundary.

Apart from the utilization of the power at the sponge iron plant, the surplus power generated by the
Waste Heat Recovery Boilers (WHRB) plant is consumed by the adjoining steel plant owned by
SBPIL which is within the same boundary as the WHRB plant.
